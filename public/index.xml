      <description>With the recent federal legalization of sports gambling I believe that sports data will become increasingly important and relevant in successfully predicting outcomes of games. For this project I obtained NFL gambling and game data from kaggle.com. The first data set included data on individual games such as schedule year and date, stadium name, home team score, away team score, and spread. The second data set recorded weather related data for these same NFL games, which included temperature, precipitation, location, stadium type (open-air or dome) and much more.</description>

In an attempt to find an answer, I obtained a data set of patients from kaggle.com in order to build a model to predict heart disease based on a patientsâ€™ symptoms when first admitted to the hospital. The dataset has 15 variables and 303 observations.</description>
