      <description>Hi, my name is Matt Gibson! I am currently a senior at the University of Texas at Austin studying biology. I was born and raised as a Longhorn here in Austin so attending UT had always been a dream of mine! I enjoy the outdoors, sports - both watching and playing, traveling and spending time with friends and family. I also have a two year old Golden Retriever named Nala!</description>

      <description>Regular Expressions! Towards the end of the semester, we learned about regular expressions, commonly refered to as regex. We can use regex to find patterns in strings using algorithms and functions such as re.findall. Regex can be applied in a biological context in many way. Below I will demontrate just one of these ways.
 Restriction Enzyme Example Here is an example from one of our homeworks. Here, I used re.</description>

      <description>With the recent federal legalization of sports gambling I believe that sports data will become increasingly important and relevant in successfully predicting outcomes of games. For this project I obtained NFL gambling and game data from kaggle.com. The first data set included data on individual games such as schedule year and date, stadium name, home team score, away team score, and spread. The second data set recorded weather related data for these same NFL games, which included temperature, precipitation, location, stadium type (open-air or dome) and much more.</description>

In an attempt to find an answer, I obtained a data set of patients from kaggle.com in order to build a model to predict heart disease based on a patientsâ€™ symptoms when first admitted to the hospital. The dataset has 15 variables and 303 observations.</description>
