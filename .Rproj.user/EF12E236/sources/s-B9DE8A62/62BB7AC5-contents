```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

spreadspoke_scores <- read.csv("~/Downloads/spreadspoke_scores.csv")
nfl_stadiums <- read.csv("~/Downloads/nfl_stadiums.csv")
```
  With the recent federal legalization of sports gambling I believe that sports data will become increasingly important and relevant in successfully predicting outcomes of games. For this project I obtained NFL gambling and game data from kaggle.com. The first data set included data on individual games such as schedule year and date, stadium name, home team score, away team score, and spread. The second data set recorded weather related data for these same NFL games, which included temperature, precipitation, location, stadium type (open-air or dome) and much more. 

  For this project I focused on NFL over-under lines. The over-under line is the predicted combined point total for a certain game set by Las Vegas bookmakers. I believed that the weather would influence the over-under line. Specifically I believed that if there was poor weather during a game (ie cold, rain, snow ect.), the teams would score less points than the set over-under line.


## Joinging and Wrangling the Data Sets
```{R, include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{R}
spreadspoke_scores%>%left_join(nfl_stadiums, by=c("stadium"="stadium_name"))-> proj1_combined
proj1_combined%>%select(-NAME,-STATION, -LATITUDE, -LONGITUDE,
-stadium_capacity, -stadium_address, -stadium_open,-stadium_weather_station_code,
-ELEVATION) -> proj1_combined
proj1_combined%>%filter(schedule_season>2006)%>%filter(!is.na(stadium_weather_type)
&!is.na(over_under_line)&!is.na(weather_temperature), 
!is.na(weather_wind_mph)) -> proj1_combined
```
In this block of code I used left_join to merge my two data sets. Both data sets included the name of the stadium where the game was played, so I decided to merge the data sets on these two variables and named it proj1_combined. In the following lines of code, I removed columns that I wouldn't be focusing on such as stadium capacity, stadium address and stadium weather station code using the select function. Next, I used filter to drop games missing data points. Lastly I used filter again to only include data from the 2006 season and later to ensure the scores being used were subject to the current NFL rules.


## Summary Statistics 
```{R}
proj1_combined%>%mutate(point_total=(score_home+score_away)) -> proj1_combined

proj1_combined%>%mutate(over_under_hit=ifelse(point_total>over_under_line, 
                                              "OVER", "UNDER")) -> proj1_combined

proj1_combined%>%select(point_total,over_under_line,spread_favorite)%>%
  arrange(desc(point_total))%>%
  glimpse

proj1_combined%>%summarize(mean(over_under_line), sd(over_under_line),min(over_under_line), 
                           max(over_under_line))

proj1_combined%>%summarize(mean(point_total), sd(point_total),
                           min(point_total), max(point_total))

proj1_combined%>%summarize(mean(spread_favorite), sd(spread_favorite),min(spread_favorite))


proj1_combined%>%group_by(stadium_weather_type)%>%
  summarize(mean(over_under_line), mean(point_total),
            mean(spread_favorite))

proj1_combined%>%group_by(weather_detail)%>%
  summarize(mean(over_under_line), mean(point_total), 
            mean(spread_favorite))

proj1_combined%>%group_by(schedule_season)%>%
  summarize(mean(over_under_line), mean(point_total))

proj1_combined%>%group_by(weather_detail)%>%count(over_under_hit)

proj1_combined%>%
  select(-schedule_season, -score_home, -score_away, -stadium_close)%>%
  select_if(is.numeric)%>%na.omit%>%cor%>%round(3)
```
In this block of code I generated summary statistics on my numeric variables. In the first two chunks of code I created two new variables using the mutate function. First, I created a variable of the total points scored in a game by combining the variables home_score and home_away. Next, I created a variable called over_under_hit using an if_else statement. This variable shows whether the point total exceeded the over under line or whether the point total fell below the line. 

The summary statistics above did not show the variation I expected to see with change in weather conditions. Only an average of 0.6 less points were scored in cold games versus warm games. In addition to this there was only a 0.1 difference between the average over under line and the total number of points scored in cold versus warm games. The largest difference I found was during rainy games. In games where rain was recorded, the under hit 55 times, while the over only hit 45 times. Lastly, I created a correlation matrix to see if there was a relationship between variables I may have missed or not thought to explore. However, as shown above the strogest r score was 0.293 - shown between the point total and over under line. Therefor, there was no r-score that indicated any type of relationship, positive or negative. 



## Plots

```{R, echo = FALSE}
proj1_combined%>%
  ggplot(aes(weather_detail,over_under_line, fill=over_under_hit))+
  geom_bar(stat = "summary")+  
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=45, hjust=1))+xlab("Weather Type")+
  ylab("Over Under Line")+ggtitle("Over Under Line vs Weather Type")

proj1_combined$schedule_season<-as.factor(proj1_combined$schedule_season)
proj1_combined%>%
  ggplot(aes(schedule_season,point_total))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  facet_wrap(~stadium_weather_type)+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=45, hjust=1),
      legend.position="none")+xlab("Schedule Year")+
  ylab("Total Points Scored")+ggtitle("Total Points Scored vs Year Across Weather Types")

proj1_combined%>%
  ggplot(aes(schedule_season,over_under_line))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  facet_wrap(~stadium_weather_type)+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=45, hjust=1),
      legend.position="none")+xlab("Schedule Year")+
  ylab("Over Under Line")+ggtitle("Over Under Line vs Year Across Weather Types")




proj1_combined%>%
  ggplot(aes(point_total, weather_temperature, color = over_under_hit ))+
  geom_point(size=2)+xlab("Total Points Scored")+ylab("Temperature")+
  ggtitle("Effect of Temperature on Points Scored")


```
The first bar chart shows that the over and under hit close to an equal number of times across different weather types, which again is the opposite of what I expected to see. The next two boxplots show that both the total points scored as well as the over under line remained relatively constant across different weather conditions between the 2007 and 2018 seasons. The last chart shows that there was no relation between the temperature during a game and the total amount of points scored. 


##PCA

```{R}
proj.nums <- proj1_combined%>%select(-stadium_close)%>%
  select_if(is.numeric)%>%scale
proj_pca <- princomp(proj.nums)
summary(proj_pca, loadings = T)

proj1_combined%>%mutate(PC1=proj_pca$scores[,1], PC2=proj_pca$scores[,2])%>%
  ggplot(aes(PC1,PC2,color=over_under_hit))+geom_point()+coord_fixed()+
  ggtitle("PCA Scores Plot")



```

After running the summary of the principle components, I would keep the first four to five principle components because their cumulative proportion of variance is close to 80%. However,the above PCA plot shows there is no main component that accounts for the variation seen in my data. 

In conclusion, the exploration and tests run on my data did not support my initial prediction that worse weather conditions would result in lower NFL scores and a higher proportion of games falling below the over-under line. If I were to do it again, I might also look at the number of plays and play types run a team in each game to see how that would affect point totals.
