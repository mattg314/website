<p>Hi, my name is Matt Gibson! I am currently a senior at the University of Texas at Austin studying biology. I was born and raised as a Longhorn here in Austin so attending UT had always been a dream of mine! I enjoy sports, both watching and playing, traveling and spending time with friends and family. I also have a two year old Golden Retriever named Nala! Hereâ€™s a picture of her eating whats left of a cupcake on her birthday:</p>
